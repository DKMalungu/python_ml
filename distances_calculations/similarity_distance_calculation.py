# Manhattan distance
"""
Manhattan distance is a metric in which the distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.
In a simple way of saying it is the total sum of the difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

# Euclidean distance
"""
The Euclidean distance between two points in either the plane or 3-dimensional space measures the length of a segment connecting the two points. 
It is the most obvious way of representing distance between two points.
